### Big O

- A way to categorise an algorithms time or memory requirements based on input
- Big O - as your input grows, how fast does your run time/memory requirements increase?

- `O(2n)` doesn't exist because we drop constants (eg the 2) because the result isn't that significant - we are interested in how it grows
- BigO we consider the worst case (i.e. we would loop through everything) - we don't consider times when the loop would exit early.
- `O(1)` does the same operation every time
- `O(logn)` - base of 2
- `O(n)` grows linearly

### Algorithms

- `const a = []` is not an array
